Done:
* Better handling clientId and the clientTopic, need to be able to remove old clientTopics when they are no longer used.
* Maybe use more instances of middleware and pulsar functions
* Client for receiving and verifying conversion
* New Dashboard showing an increase in topic load and then scaling of converter pods

In progress:
* HPA Scaling of converter (KEDA)
* Handling of Error messages in Client
* Fault tolerance, Chaos Mesh
